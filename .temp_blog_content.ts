**Can I register when I am not in Nairobi?**

Yes. It is possible to register while outside Nairobi. However, it is important to note that primarily parcels in Nairobi and its environs are available for transaction on the Ardhisasa platform at the moment, though digitization is expanding to other counties.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Profile (Account Upgrade)

### Step 2: Log In to Your Account

Having created your account already, click "Sign In" and enter your ID number and password.

Click "Login" to access your dashboard. You can update additional details, including your KRA PIN and passport-size photo.

### Step 3: Select the Land Search Service

On the dashboard, you will spot several service options related to land and property management. Locate and click on "Search" then select "Official Land Search". This option allows you to trace details of the real owner of the land as registered by the Ministry of Lands.

Remember to provide the reason for the search, which is often to identify the owner of a particular piece of land that you are interested in.

### Step 4: Enter Land Parcel Details

Select the county where the land is located to refine the search and limit it to a specific location.

Enter the Title Number or Parcel Number (e.g., Nairobi/Block123/456) then click "Search" to proceed.

### Step 5: Make Payment and Download Certificate

Once you click search, the owner of the land will be prompted to approve the request. Once they approve, the system will automatically display the land details, which you should review very carefully. These details include:
*   Registered owner(s): The name(s) of the person(s) or entity legally registered as the owner of the land.
*   Land size: The total area of the parcel, usually indicated in hectares or acres. Confirm if it matches what you are being sold.
*   Encumbrances: Any legal claims, loans, disputes, or restrictions attached to the land. For instance, if the land is being used as collateral for a loan, the system will indicate this.

To access the full land search report, you are required to pay a fee of Ksh 500. Ardhisasa provides several payment options such as M-Pesa, credit card, and bank option.

Once you complete the payment, the system will confirm receipt and automatically generate an electronic receipt. You can download or print this receipt for future reference.
